<h1>Banswara – City of a Hundred Islands</h1>
<p>
    Meaning ‘bamboo country’, Banswara in Rajasthan is a beautiful city of scenic locales and aged temples. Banswara was founded by Maharawal Jagmal Singh and was later established as a princely state under the Rajputs during the British reign. The city is also known as the ‘City of a Hundred Islands’ because of the many small islands located on the River Mahi, which flows through the region.
<br>
Surrounded by lush greenery, the flowing river and a dam, Banswara makes for a great escape from the bustling crowds of urban life. The Mahi dam, the lakes and gardens spread across the city are popular picnic spots with locals and tourists alike. There are, of course, a number of beautiful old temples in Banswara as well, which are visited by devotees all year round.
<br>
Banswara is also known as "City of a Hundred Islands", which is often referred to as "Cherrapunji of Rajasthan", because it receives the most rain in Rajasthan, as well as for the numerous islands in the Mahi River, often referred to as "Mahati", an alternate name for Mahi river, in Vayu Purana text, which flows through the city.[2] It is the greenest city in Rajasthan due to the heavy rainfall which it receives.[3] The city has a population of 101,017, of whom 51,585 are male and 49,432 are female.
